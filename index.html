          <h1>One hell of a band</h1>

          <p>
            I've been a fan of Dream Theater for several years now. My dad often
            listened to them when I was a kid but I was too young to comprehend
            their sheer awesomeness whenever he would pop in one of their albums.
            Funny enough, it wasn't until the game "Band Hero" came out in 2009
            that I started listening to them on my own. I was 21 at the time and
            starting to explore music a lot more. That game had a great list of
            artists and songs, and I ended up listening to a lot of musicians
            from that soundtrack. One of the final songs in the game was Dream
            Theater's "Pull Me Under" and it blew my brains out. I remembered
            that my dad was really into them, so I downloaded a few more songs
            that he recommended and that was the beginning of my obsession with
            these talented musicians.
          </p>
          <br />
          <img
              src="Assets/live_scenes_ny.jpg"
              style="margin: 0px 20px 20px 0px; float: left"
            />
          <p>When I was younger I never really listened to full albums. I rather
            foolishly skimmed through various songs and only downloaded them if
            the first minute or so caught my attention. Seeing as how the
            average Dream Theater song can be 8-12 minutes long, that's a
            terrible method. That's a terrible method in general, but I was
            young and stupid. One time while browsing YouTube for various songs
            I stumbled upon their <i>Live Scenes From New York</i> performance.
            Seeing them play one of my favorite tracks, "Learning to Live", was
            truly an amazing sight. But I noticed something else as I
            listened to more of the songs--they told a story. Those who are into
            music are probably familiar with what a
            <a
              href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Concept_album"
              target="_blank"
              >concept album</a
            >
            is. Some famous examples include Pink Floyd's <i>The Wall</i> and
            Queensryche's <i>Operation: Mindcrime</i>, but this was new to me.
            An album that told a story and played out like a movie instantly
            drew me in. And not just this particular album, but many of their songs that range from 8-20 minutes long.

            I then started to realize how incredibly dumb I had been when it
            came to finding songs I liked from a particular artist. Dream
            Theater made me start to listen to albums in their entirety. That sounds incredibly foolish, (and it is) but I grew
            up in the era where you could start to buy songs individually or
            search for them through more risky and unsavory methods, (tucks
            limewire under the bed in shame) so listening to an entire album felt
            weird to me. I was also a dumb kid and didn't have the attention span or appreciation for music that I do now. Instead of having dedicated albums or playlists on my ipod, I
            would often shuffle everything. But Dream Theater made me want to
            listen to more, I needed to have more. And now I own all of their
            studio albums and I still crave more.

            I've decided to learn web design and start my career. Between
            full-time work, classes, and homework I'm putting what I've learned
            to use and making a website about Dream Theater. Use the options on
            the navbar up top to learn more about the members of the band and my
            thoughts on each of their studio albums.

      <p>All of these guys are musical gods. Each of them display inhuman speed, technique, synchronization, and compsitional mastery. Most of them went to the Berklee College of Music together, Jordan Rudess got into Julliard when he was 9 years old, and Mike Mangini was a professor at Berklee before joining the band. Their shows are usually two hours long and they frequently have concerts throughout the world. If they're not doing a tour they're writing music. It's insane that they've been around for over twenty years and they're still consistently amazing.</p>

            James joined the band in 1990 when they were looking for a new
            singer and he's been with them ever since. I really enjoy listening
            to his smooth, melodic voice. He's got a pretty good range and was
            even capable of hitting an F# in "Learning to Live" which is nuts.
            Unfortunately, in 1994 he had a severe food poisoning incident that
            ruptured his vocal chords. He said he didn't feel fully recovered
            until after 2002, but he can no longer hit those higher notes he
            used to. He's still damn good, though. He's got a wonderful voice and range
            that can switch between soothing and calming to heavy and powerful.

            John is one of the founding members of Dream Theater and a godly
            monster on the guitar. In my opinion, he's the best there is. He's
            produced all of Dream Theater's albums and frequently ranks near the
            top of any "greatest guitarists of all time" lists. Whenever I see him
            play I'm always blown away and left wondering how his fingers (or the guitar 
            for that matter) don't explode.

            Another founding member of Dream Theater, John Myung is
            also a godly monster of his instrument. Wielding a six-stringed
            bass he excells at nearly every style of play. He always looks so
            calm and chill whenever I see him perform. Many have said he's the
            only musician they've known who "warms down" after a concert. He seems
            quiet, but his bass does all the talking for him. Many of the songs that
            he's written are some of my favorites such as "Learning to Live", "Trial of
            Tears", and "Breaking All Illusions".

            Sometimes known as "the keyboard wizard", Jordan's got some of the
            fastest fingers on a keyboard I've ever seen. Most progressive
            keyboard players often have several keyboards on stage set to play
            different sounds and effects, but Jordan just has one that is set to
            cycle through various effects with the press of a pedal. He joined
            the band around 1999 and helped mastermind one of their best albums
            <i>Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory</i>. He's remained with
            the band ever since and makes me wish I had taken up the piano when
            I was younger.

            Mike joined the band in 2010 after an audition with several other
            top tier drummers. He was the first to try out and set the bar damn
            high. He's been with the band ever since and is a great fit. Some
            may have had doubts about him succeeding Mike Portnoy, but after
            listening to the work he put into their self-title 2013 album, or
            what I like to call <i>Illumination Theory</i>, it was clear he's a
            powerhouse in his own right.

            Charlie only appeared on their first album
            <i>When Dream and Day Unite</i>. He's not bad by any means, I just
            think that LaBrie was a much better fit for the band and the style
            they were aiming for. He's had a couple of solo albums released in
            the 2000's, but hasn't done much else. I would have liked to hear 
            him in a band that's more classic heavy metal from the 80's.

            Kevin was a childhood friend of John Petrucci and John Myung. He
            wrote some of the bands early hits as well as the hauntingly
            beautiful "Space-Dye-Vest". He announced his departure shortly after
            they had finished recording their second album and never looked
            back. From what I've read about his departure he might have been
            fighting some form of depression or having trouble dealing with
            loneliness which is extremely visible in his aformentioned song. He
            eventually went on to become a doctor.

            Derek replaced Kevin Moore in 1994, but the only albums he worked on
            with them was <i>A Change of Seasons</i> and the criminally
            underrated <i>Falling Into Infinity.</i> He had departed due to
            creative differences with the band but remained on friendly terms
            with them. In the case of Derek, I think his fit ended up being a
            lot like Charlie Dominici's. He's great, just not what the band
            needed. He's released a few solo projects here and there, but I'd
            say I prefer Moore's and Rudess's style over his.

            Mike was one of the founders of Dream Theater and the band actually
            got their name from his father. This dude is a beast on the drums. I
            mean, every one of these guys is godly in my opinion, but there's
            something about hearing Portnoy's hits that sounds so clean and
            perfect. He's the second youngest person ever to be inducted into
            the <i>Modern Drummer</i> hall of fame with Niel Peart from Rush
            being number one. He quit drinking in 2000 and wrote a series of
            songs for Dream Theater about the 12 steps that are spread across
            several albums.

                    Their debut album isn't bad, it's just different from the
                    rest of their work. It's the only album with Charlie
                    Dominici at vocals and overall it's alright. I think
                    fans might say this is the worst album only because it's so
                    different to what their used to hearing. It's got a very
                    80's metal vibe to it, but being that it's from the 80's the
                    audio quality is a little poor. That was unfortunately an
                    issue during that time as many older albums have that sort
                    of distorted, fuzzy sound. Again, it's not terrible or
                    anything, just different.

                    While there are some alright songs on this album I'd
                    recommend skipping it entirely. It would be much better,
                    especially for those that are just getting into Dream
                    Theater, to start with other albums. I'd say to save this
                    one for last if you've heard everything they have and you want
                    more. Other than that, the album is just okay.

                    This album. Holy shit. One of my top five albums by them
                    and considered one of their best by many Dream Theater fans,
                    <i>Images and Words</i> is amazing from start to finish.
                    "Pull Me Under" went on to become a massive hit and remains
                    one of their coolest songs. It's a little played out for me,
                    but I still enjoy it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    Normally I'd recommend songs to listen to, but for this
                    album I'd end up listing every track. My personal favorites
                    are "Take the Time", "Surrounded", and the absolutely
                    incredible "Learning to Live". That last one is one of my
                    favorite songs out of their massive library. Seriously,
                    listen to this whole album. It's one of the greatest of all
                    time.

                    Probably one of my least favorite albums from them,
                    <i>Awake</i> is considered their darkest album. I don't know
                    if it's the sound quality or what, but something just sounds
                    <i>off</i> about this album. Still, it's got some great
                    songs on it. But also some not so great ones. The opening
                    track "6:00" is great and gets you pumped, "Caught In a Web"
                    is pretty good, and the instrumental "Erotomania" is pretty
                    crazy. But damn, the last three tracks kick major ass.
                    "Lifting Shadows Off a Dream" is melodic and calm. "Scarred"
                    features some excellent guitar from Petrucci. And the best
                    for last, the beautiful "Space-Dye Vest"
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    I used to not care for this album all that much mostly
                    because the quality sounds weird. But after listening to it
                    a few more times I've grown to like it. That's often the
                    case with Dream Theater's albums. Some of the songs can be
                    so long and there's so much going on that it might take a
                    few tries to really like an album. I wouldn't say that's a
                    bad thing, it's just something you have to kind of get used
                    to with them.

                    This album is their only EP released and also marks the debut of Derek Sherinian. It's 
                    comprised of two discs with one being a collection of live cover songs which are just okay. 
                    The real star of this show is on the other disc which contains the title track coming in at 
                    23 minutes. "A Change of Seasons" is aboslutely amazing. It might sound like a tough sell to 
                    listen to a 23 minute song, but damn is it one amazing journey. There's a very good live version 
                    of this song that was played on their <i>Live Scenes From New York</i> tour that's my preferred 
                    way of listening to the song. The lyrics take you through the cycle of life, and did I mention 
                    it's amazing? I just wanted to make sure you get it.
                  </p>
                  <p>While not technically a studio album, I wanted to include it on the list since I thought it 
                    would be a crime not to bring up this song. You should give the cover songs a listen too, but 
                    the main attraction is what this EP is all about.</p>

                    Many fans consider this to be their worst album and I completely disagree. I think why people 
                    are disappointed with it is because of how mellow it is, especially after coming off of <i>Awake</i>. 
                    There's also a lot of stories about the band not being happy with the record label or something, but 
                    I feel like that story changes every time it's told. "Peruvian Skies", (or what some call <i>Petruccian Skies</i> 
                    due to the excellent guitar playing) is a great track and very relaxing. "Hells Kitchen" and "Lines in the Sand" 
                    are really great too. But man, "Take Away My Pain" and "Trial of Tears" give me some serious goosebumps. For what 
                    most fans consider their worst album it sure has some great tracks on it.
                  </p>
                  <p>I definitely recommend <i>Falling Into Infinity</i>. Just don't go in expecting some hard or fast metal, cause 
                    that's just not what this album is about. It's pretty calm and relaxing. And sometimes that's just what one needs.</p>

                    A fan favorite and probably my #1 favorite, (and maybe even one of the greatest albums of all time) 
                    is <i>Metropolis Part 2: Scenes From a Memory</i>, or just <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>. A sequel of 
                    sorts to a track off of <i>Images and Words</i>, this concept album plays out like a movie telling 
                    the story of a man named Nicholas who keeps having nightmares of a hauntingly familiar girl. He goes 
                    to see a hypnotist to find out what these dreams are and most importantly, who the girl is and where 
                    he knows her from. This album is non-stop kick-assery and I can't say enough about. It's best to listen 
                    to this album in one sitting so you can piece the story together for yourself and find out who the msyterious 
                    Victoria is and what happened to her.
                  </p>
                  <p>Sherinian parted just after one album, but with Jordan Rudess joining them for this and helping get it started, it's proof enough that Rudess was what the band needed. It would be a disservice to spoil the story of the album, so if you're desperate to know just go listen to it. Only read up on it afterwards so you can fill in the blanks. Damn this one of the greatest albums I've ever heard. 2019 marked the 20th anniversary of the album, and during their tour they played the whole thing from start to finish. What an amazing show.</p>

                    This album tends to be a little divisive among fans. Some only like half the album, and which half that is varies from person to person. The album is on two discs with the first being a collection of songs that explore different themes in life, while the second is a concept album that deals with different metal illnesses. I'm not really a fan of the concept album portion, but I think the first disc has some great tracks on it. "The Great Debate" is pretty good, but the opening track, "The Glass Prison", is one of their all-time bests.</p>
                  <p>The album is just okay in my opinion. I think I was partially let down because I thought the concept album would be another story like <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>, but it's not like that at all. Not bad, but not all that great either. "The Glass Prison" is the first song in a series about Portnoy's recovery from alcoholism. The other songs are spread across the next several albums, but this one is the best of the group. I also want to point out that all of Dream Theater's covers are super cool and thought provoking, but the cover for this album feels really boring when compared to the rest since it's just the title. I sort of wish they had done something with broken glass around the title with reflections of the "six degrees" featured in the second disc.</p>

                    Definitely their hardest album, <i>Train of Thought</i> doesn't have that many tracks but kicks serious ass from start to finish. "As I Am" is a great and heavy opener for the album, and "This Dying Soul" is the second of five of Portnoy's 12 steps saga and is great song on it's own. "Honor Thy Father" and "In the Name of God" are my personal favorites on the album, and we can't forget "Stream of Conciousness" which is a crazy eleven minute instrumental that serves as an opening for the final track. Seriously, this album is hard as hell and easily in my top five.</p>
                    <p>"Vacant" is probably the weakest track on this album only because the rest is just so damn good. I first heard this album when I was 20 or so and only liked one or two songs. I didn't try listening to it again until several years later and hate myself for not liking it sooner.</p>

                    <i>Octavarium</i> opens with the third part of Portnoy's 12 steps saga, "The Root of All Evil". I think this album's pretty good, especially "These Walls" and "Panic Attack". The rest of the album is pretty decent, and I like "I Walk Beside You" a lot too. The worst track is unfortunately the final one which happens to be the title track. "Octavarium" is 24 minutes long, but I think the first 3 or 4 is just the sound of the wind. It's got a really slow start and just doesn't pack the same emotional punch that their other long epic, "A Change of Seasons" does. Still, as a whole I'd say it's worth a listen anyway.</p>
                    <p>You could give the title track a shot if you've got 24 minutes to kill, but out of their all their epics, "Octavarium" is easily their weakest one. The album gets its name from something to do with octaves and their previous albums, but I don't know enough about music to understand it.</p>

                    Their 2007 album was another one of those occasions where I didn't really care for it at first but really liked it when I listened to it again several years later. While not exactly a concept album, <i>Systematic Chaos</i> is comprised of individual stories. "In the Presence of Enemies" parts 1 and 2 are great open/closer for the album, but I prefer to listen to them back to back. I feel it's a bit underrated, but "Forsaken" is a pretty kick ass song too. Part 4 of Portnoy's 12 steps saga is on this album as "Repentance" and I think it's the worst one of the group. Mostly because the song is ten minutes long and it's kind of slow. I feel like the tempo and the energy should pick up at some point during the song, but it never happens and it's kind of a bummer.</p>
                    <p>This is a pretty good album. The content of the songs makes me wish this was a concept album with a linear story similar to <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>, but it would be some time before Dream Theater attempted that again. I could definitely see a cool story revolving around a fallen being serving a dark master and being the cause for the world's downfall. "The Dark Eternal Night" has a great chorus that's perfect for the kind of idea.</p>

                    One of my top five albums from them and another short one, <i>Black Clouds & Silver Linings</i> is the kick ass tenth album for the group. It starts off with the amazing "A Nightmare to Remember" and then dives into the crazy "A Rite of Passage". "Wither" is kind of a weird addition to such a heavy album, but there's actually a version with just the piano that's really enojoyable and I feel fits the song better. Portnoy's 12 step saga concludes with "The Shattered Fortress" which is a fantastic ending for the journey that is kind of a medley of the previous songs. It's pretty cool to listen to all them back to back. Then, holy crap, the album finishes with "The Count of Tuscany". An 18 minute epic that tells a fascinating story based on a real experience from John Petrucci. Damn that song gives me chills</p>
                  <p>There was also a bonus disc sold in special editions that had a few cover songs. They're alright, but I feel Dream Theater is at their best when they do their own thing. Sadly, this was Mike Portnoy's final album with the band. I was heartbroken to see him go and feared they wouldn't be able to find anyone of his caliber to fill that spot. Portnoy has worked on various projects over the years and I think he's still the best drummer there is.</p>

                    After a pretty cool <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DZ3DMDxdpfM" target="_blank" style="color:white;">2 part audition for new drummers</a>, Dream Theater acquired Mike Mangini to fill the deep hole left by Mike Portnoy. I was really worried at first cause in my mind, who the hell was going to be better than Mike Portnoy? The answer: Mike Mangini. While he wasn't involved in writing any the music for their 2011 album, he really stepped up and proved he was the right man for the job. <i>A Dramatic Turn of Events</i> almost feels like a reset for the band and I think it has the same kind of sound as <i>Images and Words</i>. "On the Backs of Angels" reminds me a lot of "Pull Me Under", while "This Is the Life" is a little more chill but still a good listen. Then there's the one-two punch that is "Far From Heaven" and the incredible "Breaking All Illusions". Damn those songs are excellent.</p>
                  <p>The rest of the album is pretty good, but it doesn't quite hit the same excellence that <i>Images and Words</i> did. The album is great despite some fan criticism. Sure, they don't do anything particularly new here, but I think that's what they were going for. They had to go back to the beginning to sort of find out who they were with the addition of Mangini, and I'm fine with that.</p>

                    They decided to go with a self-titled name for their twelfth album. I'm not really a fan of that naming convention unless it's for a debut album, so I've taken to naming it after the epic finisher like <i>Octavarium</i> or <i>A Change of Seasons</i> did in the past. This album was Mangini's debut with song-writing, and damn is it good--one of my top five for sure. Every song on the album is absolute perfection. My personal favorites are "The Enemy Inside", "Behind the Veil", and "Along For the Ride". It really is an amazing experience from start to finish and has one of the best album covers in their repitoire.</p>
                  <p>The album ends with their latest epic "Illumination Theory", and holy crap is it good. Coming in at 22 minutes, this beast of a song features an orchestra and covers topics that people live, die, and kill for. The whole thing has a sort of life of the universe feel as you listen to it. I really can't recommend this album enough. I feel it's really overlooked among the fanbase for some reason and deserves more attention. I really do wish they had just called the album "Illumination Theory", though.</p>

                    2016 was a really crappy year for everyone, but Dream Theater made things a little better with their newest concept album <i>The Astonishing</i>. While it doesn't reach the same heights as <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>, it's still an amazing experience and criminally underrated by the fans. While their first concept album is told like a movie, <i>The Astonishing</i> is something more like a musical play. I think that's fantastic but I understand how that might not be for everyone. This awesome story takes place in a dystopian, sci-fi/fantasy world where music no longer exists. A man named Gabriel has a natural ability to make music and inspires the masses. But King Nafaryus feels threatened by him and plots to have him killed to maintain the status quo.</p>
                  <p>This story is packed with over two hours of music and is filled with tons of themes like rebellion, love, and betrayal. Some have compared it to Rush's 1976 album <i>2112</i>, and while the overall theme may be kind of similar I think <i>The Astonishing</i> is much better. If you like musicals and stage plays, give this one a shot. It might be a little hard to figure out which character is singing what song at what time on your first listen, but I suggest checking out the wikipedia page by clicking on the album picture if you really want to get into it.</p>

                    The album art for their most recent album is my favorite of the bunch. The image of a mechanical hand holding a human skull is a perfect match for the title <i>Distance Over Time</i>. This album is damn good too. Nearly every track kicks some serious ass with "At Wit's End" being my personal favorite. In fact, the only songs I don't really care for are "Pale Blue Dot" and "Viper King". They're okay, they just don't have the same <i>oomph</i> that the rest of the album has. Some may say this is a fairly average album, but I think there's a lot of good stuff packed into it.</p>
                  <p>The year this album came out also marked the 20th anniversary of <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>. I was fortunate enough to see them in concert where they played several songs from <i>Distance Over Time</i>, seven other songs from various albums, and the entirety of <i>Scenes From a Memory</i>. Holy shit was that concert amazing. It also happened to be the first show on the tour, so they were at their best when I saw them. Now I will never miss a show from them no matter how expensive the tickets are.</p>
