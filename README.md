### DREAM THEATER TRIBUTE PAGE

I'm currently taking a coding extension course and wanted to create a website using the skills 
I've learned so far.

## ABOUT

This is a student project about my favorite band. The main index.html contains a small introduction.
When clicking on the buttons located on the navbar, you can see what I've written about each member
of the band and their discography. I've also provided a link to their official site and respective
wikipedia pages.
