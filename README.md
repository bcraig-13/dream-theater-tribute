### DREAM THEATER TRIBUTE PAGE

I made this tribute page during my first three weeks in a coding bootcamp.

## ABOUT

This is a student project about my favorite band. The main index.html contains a small introduction.
When clicking on the buttons located on the navbar you can see what I've written about each member
of the band and their discography. I've also provided a link to their official site and respective
wikipedia pages.

There is only one html file that holds the index. The different "pages" containing the information about
the members and albums is hidden by default and changes the display when clicking on one of the navbar 
links. Clicking on one will set the targeted link to active and remove active from the remaining two.

## BUILT WITH

-Bootstrap
-jQuery
